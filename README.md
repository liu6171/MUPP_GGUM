The files contain R code (.r) and workspace (.rdata) to conduct the maximum marginal likelihood estimation with an expectation-maximization algorithm (MML-EM) on 
the multi-unidimensional pairwise preference model (MUPP) coupled with the dichotomous version of the generalized graded unfolding model (GGUM) using the mirt package.
